# Big O Notation Exercise

1. What is the Big O for this?
    1. constant time
    2. linear time

2. Even or Odd
    * constant time O(1) becuase it is a simple arithmetic operation

3. Are you here?
    * polynomial time O(n^2) because it is two nested for loops 

4. Doubler
    * linear time O(n) becuase it is one for loop with a sum calculation

5. Naive Search
    * linear time O(n) becuase it is one loop with a return

6. Creating Pairs
    * polynomial time O(n^2) because it is two nested loops

7. Compute the Sequence 
    * linear time O(n) becuase it is one loop

8. An Efficient Search
    * logarithmic time O(log(n)) becuase each time through the loop, it cuts the problem size in half

9. Random Element
    * constant time O(1) because it is a simple arithmetic operation

10. What am I?
    * linear time O(n) because it is one loop with a simple arithmetic operation
